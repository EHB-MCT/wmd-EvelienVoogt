This project uses:
- Node.js + Express
- PostgreSQL
- Knex.js for database access
- React for the frontend (user-facing and admin interface)
- Docker Compose for local runtime

Rules:
- Do not introduce new frameworks or databases
- Do not replace React with another frontend framework
- Follow the existing folder structure
- Prefer simple, explicit code over abstractions
- No cloud services or external APIs
- Assume all services run locally via docker-compose

All database changes go through Knex migrations.
All routes must be registered explicitly.
The frontend contains a user-facing interface and an admin interface,
separated by routing and folder structure within the same React application.
